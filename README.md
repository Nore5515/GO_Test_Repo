# GO_Test_Repo

Attempting to learn and become familiar with GO, I want to begin by writing a few simple programs.

1) A simple calculator with Add(x,y), Subtract(x,y), Power(x,y), Division(x,y), Multipication(x,y), Sqrt(x,y), Fibb(x,y)

2) A program that lets you "breed" cats, each cat being it's own object with Color, Personality, Size, Fuzz Count and Tail Length. I should have to breed the perfect cat (randomly selected) by breeding my current cat with my specified cat (from a list of three randomly selected cats).

3) A program that opens a window with Name of File, Time Logged On, Text, Save and Quit on it. I should be able to find the saved file
